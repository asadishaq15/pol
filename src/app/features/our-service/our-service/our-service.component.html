            Who will do your eulogy and how do they know the things that you
            cherish most in your life? Is your information correct? Leave it
            yourself for free in the Auto obituary section. Help the pastor or
            priest with your eulogy so that they are not searching for
            information about you or the things that you loved about your life.
            You lived your life and only you can tell your story the way you
            experience it.

            These are all pearls that each one of us have experienced and know
            carry with us. They should not be tossed away or forgotten upon our

            What if PEARLS OF MY LYFE existed in the past? You could click a
            place in this website and see an old family member talking to you
            about the things they cherished the most and want to leave the
            memory behind for you to have; or what if they left behind some
            wisdom that could keep you out of trouble and on a good path in
            life. That is how it is supposed to be, family passing down
            traditions, wisdom, knowledge and many other things.

          <p>
            Sometimes we don’t have the words when we are in front of loved
            ones. Some relationships are estranged and it’s hard to communicate.
            You still care about them and have value to give them. Now, you can
            take your time, think about what this life and your loved ones have
            meant to you; and leave it all in your PEARLS OF MY LYFE account.
